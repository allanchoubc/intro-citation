Citation management software, also known as reference management software,  bibliographic management software or citation managers, can help you manage and organize your citations and format bibliographies and footnotes in your papers.

There are different citation management tools available - some are for free while others require a paid subscription.  This workshop will focus on RefWorks, Mendeley, and Zotero. All citation managers carry out the same basic functions but specific features may vary from program to program.

Most citation management tools can help you to:
- Import citation information from databases and library catalogs
- Collect, organize, and annotate citations
- Manage PDF articles
- Generate bibliographies and format footnotes or endnotes in a variety of styles
