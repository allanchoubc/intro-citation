heh* The help pages of github are a good place to start: https://help.github.com/ 
* Github has 'activities' which aim to explain how git works: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
* Some indepth but clear tutorials on using git. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials
* A website aimed at historians but useful for librarians/those interested in Digital Humanities. The project uses Github and a programme called Jekyll to manage new lessons/the website. A useful place to see a non coding use of github in action: programminghistorian.org
